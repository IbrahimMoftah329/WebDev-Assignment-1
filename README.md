# WebDev-Assignment-1
Calculator 


Assignment 1
Due march 12th
Given the calculator code I would like you to finish the function stub in order to actually
calculate.
there are a couple of methods of doing this, but the one I would like you to use (that I think is
easiest) is using an expression tree.

Things of note:
You could easily find full code of how to do this online (or even in this article) - I ask that you
refrain from using those, as doing it yourself is learning an algorithm and applying it (which is
necessary for the interviews you will have to do in your career if you want to be employed)

ChatGPT
Feel free to use chat gpt to understand the algorithm better (or in ways similar to what I outline
below), but please actually use your human brain to consider the problem.

Chatgpt is a great tool. One way I like to use it: when I was learning how to do python, I came
from a javascript background. Something easy you can do is say: “what is the python equivalent
of this method in javascript” - I strongly encourage this usage, as it will let you transition your
skills from c++ into skills in javascript very effectively, but be sure to take it a step beyond by
actually reading the mdn documentation about it.

Some things you will likely need for this assignment

Basic node class:

class Node{
  constructor(val = null, left = null, right = null){
  this.val = val;
  this.left = left;
  this.right = right;
}
}

javascript has no built-in stack / queue
